# Merchant Buccaneer
Genre: Adventure/Strategy 

Concept: The player controls a pirate ship tasked with transporting goods from one port to another. Along the way, AI-controlled pirate ships try to attack and plunder the cargo. Navigate treacherous waters, avoid or combat rival pirates, and deliver goods safely. There is also a system for offer/demand where in some islands the price of the goods are cheaper than in others.

## Key Features:
### Player Controls:
- Ship navigation with realistic sailing mechanics.
- Cannon aiming and firing to fend off attackers.
### AI Pirates:
- Various AI-controlled pirate ships with different behaviors (aggressive, sneaky, tactical).
- Adaptive AI that responds to the player's actions and strategies.
### Physics:
- Realistic water and weather effects that impact navigation.
- Collision detection with islands, other ships, and obstacles.
- Cannonball physics, including trajectories and impact effects.
### Economy and Trading:
- Buying and selling goods at ports.
- Managing ship repairs, upgrades, and crew.
- Fluctuating prices and demand based on events in the game world.
### Level Design:
- Multiple routes and destinations with varying difficulty.
- Dynamic events like storms, naval patrols, or treasure discoveries.
### Mission and Challenges:
- Timed missions, escort quests, or special cargo requirements.
- Achievements and rewards for successful voyages.

## Deliverables
- Game and source code
- Presentation highlighting technical aspects and architectural considerations of the code. Best Practices, etc.
- Explain external lib uses. With focus on dev time, flexibility and no vendor locking 
- Try to archive a good architecture with SOLID principles with minimal impact on performance (use c++ features and cache friendlines. Profile)
